# CFD-Simulation

This repo contains a few example of computational fluid dynamics videos and their code written by me on MATLAB - except for the 2D incompressible cylinder (PyFR).

* Isentropic Vortex
* Multidimensional Heat Diffusion
* Lid-Driven Square Cavity Flow
* 2D Incompressible Cylinder

## Isentropic Vortex

For this simulation, a periodic domain of length ![Output sample](https://github.com/DiscoBroccoli/CFD-Simulation/blob/main/Latex_Equation/Lx.gif) is created.
